Installing the HAT

This guide will hopefully get you up and running with HAT quickly. Some parts of this guide will depend on if you 
are going to have more than one database or support more than one server. At the minimum you will need one database 
as everything can be in one database but you could have more. Eventually my goal is to have an install script of
sorts, but for now, this will do.

1. Copy all files to appropriate directory on your server. 

For best results, the panel should be installed on the same server as you're running Hercules on. This will make 
the panel able to start/stop/restart the server as well as modify the configuration files AND execute GM commands
on the running server. You can also view metric data about the running server on the panel itself.

2. Ensure you have the required packages installed and the server configured.

You will need at the minimum the following packages installed:

* apache2
* php5 with extensions php5-mcrypt and php5-mysql.
( to enable mcrypt on a unix php insert `extension=mcrypt.so` into your php.ini )
* apache2 needs to be configured to allow .htaccess files, with the mod_rewrite extension and your per directory 
settings needs to `follow symlinks` and `AllowOverride all`.

3. Edit config/config.php. See the configuration help in that file. At a minimum the following needs to be edited:

$config['base_url']
$config['encryption_key']
$config['sess_cookie_name']
$config['cookie_domain']

4. Edit config/hat.php. At a minimum you will need to change the following:

$config['panelname']
$config['servername']
$config['ragnarok_servers']

4a. !!! Important config note !!!

If you separate out your log tables into another database, you must edit hat.php accordingly under $config['ragnarok_servers'].
See that file for more information regarding this setting.

4b. !!! Important config note !!!

If your server runs like this:
                                     |==========|      |=========|
                                     |   char   |      |   map   |
                            /========|  server  |======|  server |
         |--------------|  /         |    s1    |      |         |
         |              | /          |==========|      |=========|
         |    login     |/           
         |    server    |\           
         |              | \          |==========|      |=========|
         |--------------|  \         |   char   |      |   map   |
                            \========|  server  |======|  server |
                                     |    s2    |      |         |
                                     |==========|      |=========|

HAT can help you! See the details in /doc/MultipleCharMap.txt for more details.

5. Edit config/database.php. Your database groups must match up with what you named them in your database and in hat.php.

6. Run the files in /doc/sql/:

hat_login = run this in your login database.
hat_charmap = run this in your char/map database(s).

7. Run the following query on the database you ran hat_login on, substituting YOUR_LOGIN_TABLE, YOUR_LOGIN_NAME, YOUR_PASSWORD and YOUR_EMAIL for your desired values:

INSERT INTO `YOUR_LOGIN_TABLE`.`hat_users` (`username`, `passwd`, `pemail`, `createdate`, `lastactive`, `groupid`, `disablelogin`) VALUES ('YOUR_LOGIN_NAME', MD5('YOUR_PASSWORD'), 'YOUR_EMAIL', NOW(), '', '99', '0');

8. Navigate to the location you installed HAT to and you should be able to use your username and password to login and start adding additional users!
